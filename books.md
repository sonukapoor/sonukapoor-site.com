Over the years, I’ve been fortunate to share my knowledge not only through articles and talks but also through books.  
My writing focuses on **practical development**, **Angular and AI**, and **building strong foundations in JavaScript**.  

In addition to authoring my own titles, I’ve also been invited to serve as a **technical editor** for several books from leading publishers like Manning and O’Reilly — a role that reflects both peer recognition and trust in my expertise.

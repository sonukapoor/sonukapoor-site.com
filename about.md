I often say my career didn’t start with a job title — it started with a spark. That spark lit up when I was twelve years old at a friend’s birthday party in Germany, where I saw a **Commodore 64** for the first time. The green glow of its screen was enough to hook me. I begged my father for a computer, and after much persistence, he eventually surprised me with an **Amiga 500**.

That Amiga came with two thick books on BASIC programming. I read them cover to cover until the pages wore thin, teaching myself to build small games and animations. By my teenage years, I wasn’t just playing with computers — I was learning to think in algorithms and systems. Those early nights spent typing code set the stage for everything that followed.

## From Curiosity to Career

In the year 2000, a German newspaper article changed my trajectory. It announced a plan to bring thousands of Indian tech professionals to Germany. I saw an opportunity, so I moved back to **India for a year**, immersing myself in web programming. With no safety net but plenty of ambition, I built my first portfolio, and when I returned to Germany, I landed my first programming job almost immediately.

That leap of faith ignited a career that would take me across industries, continents, and technologies.

- **Microsoft MVP (2005–2010)** — Recognized six consecutive years for leadership in the global developer ecosystem.
- **Citigroup** — Architected the frontend for a **$4B global trading platform**, bringing real-time data streaming to traders.
- **American Apparel** — Directed engineering for the company’s pioneering **RFID retail rollout**, transforming supply chain and inventory accuracy.

## Continuing the Journey

In 2024, I was once again honored with the **Microsoft MVP Award**, after a 13-year gap, alongside being recognized as a **Google Developer Expert (Angular)**. Few developers hold both distinctions at the same time.

Today, I split my time between **consulting with enterprises**, **writing books and articles**, **contributing to Angular and open source**, and **mentoring the next generation**. What started with curiosity in front of a green screen has grown into a global career spanning **AI, Angular, and developer education**.

## Looking Ahead

I’ve been fortunate to turn a childhood obsession into a career that spans continents, industries, and communities. And even now, decades later, I still feel that same spark I did as a 12-year-old kid staring at a glowing green screen — excited to see what I can build next.

  <p>I’ve been featured, quoted, and publicly recognized across leading publications, interviews, and high-visibility showcases that highlight my work in Angular, AI, and enterprise technology.</p>

<section id="times-square-billboard" class="media-spotlight">
  <h2>Times Square Billboard Spotlight – New York City</h2>
  <p>
    In 2025, I was featured on a digital billboard in New York’s Times Square as part of a professional
    spotlight campaign with TopMate. The feature highlighted my work in Angular, AI-augmented development,
    and enterprise modernization, and served as a high-visibility recognition of my contributions to the
    global developer community.
  </p>
  <p>
    The Times Square placement complements my interviews, quotes, and features in leading publications,
    and is documented below through on-site photos and an official certificate from TopMate.

    <h3>Angular Signals: The End of RxJS Boilerplate?</h3>
    <img src="/images/publisher/code.png" class="publisher-logo" alt="Publisher: CODE Magazine" />
    <p class="card-desc">In this article, I'll take a deep dive into Angular Signals, not merely as a new API, but as a new way of thinking about building applications. I'll explore their core primitives, signal(), computed(), and effect(), and understand how they seamlessly fit into Angular's vision for a zoneless, standalone component-driven future. I'll introduce the concept of LinkedSignal, a powerful feature that dramatically improves component-to-component reactivity without the tedious ceremony developers are used to.

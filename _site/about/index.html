    <h1>About</h1>
  
  <p>I often say my career didn’t start with a job title — it started with a spark. That spark lit up when I was twelve years old at a friend’s birthday party in Germany, where I saw a <strong>Commodore 64</strong> for the first time. The green glow of its screen was enough to hook me. I begged my father for a computer, and after much persistence, he eventually surprised me with an <strong>Amiga 500</strong>.</p>

<p>That Amiga came with two thick books on BASIC programming. I read them cover to cover until the pages wore thin, teaching myself to build small games and animations. By my teenage years, I wasn’t just playing with computers — I was learning to think in algorithms and systems. Those early nights spent typing code set the stage for everything that followed.</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="from-curiosity-to-career">From Curiosity to Career</h2>

<p>In the year 2000, a German newspaper article changed my trajectory. It announced a plan to bring thousands of Indian tech professionals to Germany. I saw an opportunity, so I moved back to <strong>India for a year</strong>, immersing myself in web programming. With no safety net but plenty of ambition, I built my first portfolio, and when I returned to Germany, I landed my first programming job almost immediately.</p>

<p>That leap of faith ignited a career that would take me across industries, continents, and technologies.</p>

<h2 id="building-global-experience">Building Global Experience</h2>

<ul>
  <li><strong>DotNetSlackers.com</strong> — Founded one of the early online developer communities, serving <strong>33 million+ views worldwide</strong>.</li>
  <li><strong>Microsoft MVP (2005–2010)</strong> — Recognized six consecutive years for leadership in the global developer ecosystem.</li>
  <li><strong>Citigroup</strong> — Architected the frontend for a <strong>$4B global trading platform</strong>, bringing real-time data streaming to traders.</li>
  <li><strong>American Apparel</strong> — Directed engineering for the company’s pioneering <strong>RFID retail rollout</strong>, transforming supply chain and inventory accuracy.</li>
  <li><strong>Sony Music Publishing</strong> — Led Angular migrations and AI-driven digital transformation initiatives.</li>
  <li><strong>Move to Canada</strong> — Canada became my long-term home and the base for my consulting practice, SOLID Software Solutions.</li>
</ul>

<hr />

<h2 id="continuing-the-journey">Continuing the Journey</h2>

<p>In 2024, I was once again honored with the <strong>Microsoft MVP Award</strong>, after a 13-year gap, alongside being recognized as a <strong>Google Developer Expert (Angular)</strong>. Few developers hold both distinctions at the same time.</p>

<p>Today, I split my time between <strong>consulting with enterprises</strong>, <strong>writing books and articles</strong>, <strong>contributing to Angular and open source</strong>, and <strong>mentoring the next generation</strong>. What started with curiosity in front of a green screen has grown into a global career spanning <strong>AI, Angular, and developer education</strong>.</p>

<h2 id="looking-ahead">Looking Ahead</h2>

<p>I’ve been fortunate to turn a childhood obsession into a career that spans continents, industries, and communities. And even now, decades later, I still feel that same spark I did as a 12-year-old kid staring at a glowing green screen — excited to see what I can build next.</p>

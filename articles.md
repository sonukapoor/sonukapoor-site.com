    <p class="card-desc">In this second part, we’re going to build on that foundation. We’ll extend the CartService with a few critical capabilities such as removing items, clearing the cart, and tracking the number of products. We’ll also explore how this service integrates with Angular components and templates, using signals directly without the need for RxJS or the async pipe. Along the way, we’ll highlight how this approach enhances testability, performance, and debuggability.

    <h3>Angular Signals: The End of RxJS Boilerplate?</h3>
    <img src="/images/publisher/code.png" class="publisher-logo" alt="Publisher: CODE Magazine">
    <p class="card-desc">In this article, I'll take a deep dive into Angular Signals, not merely as a new API, but as a new way of thinking about building applications. I'll explore their core primitives, signal(), computed(), and effect(), and understand how they seamlessly fit into Angular's vision for a zoneless, standalone component-driven future. I'll introduce the concept of LinkedSignal, a powerful feature that dramatically improves component-to-component reactivity without the tedious ceremony developers are used to.
